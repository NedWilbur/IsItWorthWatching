Many things are more enjoyable when you experience them with little to no expectations. Having something overhyped sets the expectations high and makes it easier for that thing to disappoint.

This website is for those who want to reduce the chances watching a sh*tty movie but also do not want to have their expectations set too high. It achieves this by answering one simple question with one simple answer.

The algorithm to decide to answer this question has been my lifelong achievement and has taken years of development. It has been fine-tuned, reviewed, and approved by the most notable movie critics, mathematicians, magicians, and wizards.
