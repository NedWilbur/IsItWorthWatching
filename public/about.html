         <h1>About</h1>
         <p>
             Many things are more enjoyable when you experience them with little to no expectations. Having something
             "hyped"
             sets the expectations high and makes it easier for that thing to dissapoint.
         </p>
         <p>
             When a movie has high reviews, your expectations are set high going into the movie. This makes the movie
             less
             enjoyable and more likely to dissapoint.
         </p>
         <p>This website is for those who do not want to watch a sh*tty movie, but also do not want to have their
             expectations set too high.</p>
