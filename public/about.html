         <p>
             Many things are more enjoyable when you experience them with little to no expectations. Having something
             overhyped sets the expectations high and makes it easier for that thing to disappoint.
         </p>
         <p>This website is for those who want to reduce the chances watching a sh*tty movie but also do not
             want to have their
             expectations set too high. It achieves this by answering one simple question with one simple answer.</p>
         <p>The algorithm to decide to answer this question has been my lifelong achievement and has taken years of
             development. It has been fine-tuned, reviewed, and approved by the most notable movie critics,
             mathematicians, magicians, and wizards. If you wish to view this complex algorithm, <a
                 onclick="document.getElementById('algorithm').hidden = false;">click
                 here</a>. </p>
         <pre id="algorithm" hidden>
             <code>
        if (movie.rating >= 60%) 
            return 'Yes.'; 
        else 
            return 'No.';</code>
